# Code Quiz 
This quiz was created as an attempt to implement my knowledge of Javascript combined with HTML & CSS to create a dynamic application on just the front end. The implementation includes many useful method's and elements such as the use of local storage objects in the window. Event listener's that react when coordinated input is received as directed. Also the ability to render things dynamically in the browser using with plain javascript.

## Overview
There are many built-in methods and properties in the language of javascript. These integrated assets can be very useful if a developer knows what is available to use and the ability to read, at times, complicated documentation. There are many many ways to do something in the language of javascript but just as there are many ways to right, there are many many ways to be wrong. At the end of the day I think it will be most important to find an identity as a developer. In our intricate world of programming there are many things that are enforced by us as developers to keep things consistent but there is a lot of room for personal choice as well. I hope to keep learning and building my own personal identity so that I and Javascript may become a powerhouse.
